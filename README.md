# STRANGER GAME
This is a humble little Java adventure text game. **Disclaimer:** we totally *"borrowed"* themes from countless nostalgic pop culture references. They didn't **all** make it into the current rendition, but there are a few Easter Eggs mixed in there. 
The concept of the game is very simple: you wake up in a haunted maze in a fantasy land, and you're racing against time to get to the end of the maze and escape. Be warned, there are challenges along the way. 

## Motivation
This project was created by a team of three newbie software development engineer military apprentices as a challenge during a work training exercise. The expecation was to build a text adventure game full of getters/setters, try/catches and custom exceptions, with the goal of building an uncrashable, although unremarkable, game in a short timeline. 
The project was conducted utilizing agile methodoly and SCRUM, with direct feedback from the "product owner," aka: the instructor. As of writing this README, this work was completed by a team of three developers over two 3-day sprints. It's not pretty, and it's not practical, but it works.
